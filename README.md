# USB Persistence Setup Script

This script automates the creation of persistence on a USB drive containing a live Linux system.

## üîß Prerequisites

- **Root privileges**: Run the script with `sudo`.
- **USB drive identification**: Use `sudo fdisk -l` to identify the device (look for the one matching your drive's size).
- **A prepared USB drive**: Ensure the USB drive has a live ISO already written to it.

## üöÄ What the Script Does

1. **Partitioning**:  
   - Creates a **512MB** partition for persistence.
   - Allocates the remaining space for ISO storage.

2. **Formatting**:  
   - Formats both partitions as `ext4`.
   - Labels the partitions as `persistence` (for persistence) and `iso` (for the ISO storage).

3. **Setup Persistence**:  
   - Mounts the persistence partition.
   - Creates a `persistence.conf` file with the configuration line `/ union` to enable persistence.
   - Unmounts the partition after setup.
